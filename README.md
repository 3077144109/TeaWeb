# Official TeaSpeak-Web Issue Tracker ![](https://travis-ci.org/TeaSpeak/TeaWeb.svg?branch=master)

Welcome here! This repository is created with two reasons:
1. People can bring their own ideas and follow their implementation
2. People can see TeaSpeak Web client progress and avoid creating repetitive issues all the time.
